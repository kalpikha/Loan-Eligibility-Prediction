# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction

Predicting if customers are eligible for the loan

• Performed univariate and bivariate analysis using seaborn and determined that males, married
  people, people with 2 dependents, graduate individuals and people with credit history 1.0 have more
  chances to be eligible for the loan.
  
• Filled missing values with median for continuous data and mode for categorical data.

• Balanced the data, and chose the final model as Random Forest with max_depth = 5 as it yielded
  more precision than other models. The f1-score on validation data is 0.74.
